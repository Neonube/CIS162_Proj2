                    <p>This list contains items which are the bare minimum that you should buy or acquire for your new hobby before you start or shortly after you start. The items are listed in the order of use.</p>



<ul>
<li>A Hobby Knife
<ul>
<li>Having a hobby knife, like an X-Acto knife, will be essential for removing flash and smoothing mold seams, especially if you do not have any files. Hobby knives are available at arts and crafts stores, artist supply houses, hardware stores, and internet retailers. Hobby knives cost about $3-4.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Toothbrush and Dish Soap
<ul>
<li>After you have cleaned your miniature of flash, mold lines, and other artifacts of the casting process, you will want to give it a good scrub with an old, soft toothbrush and some dish washing soap.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Primer
<ul>
<li>After cleaning and drying your miniature, you will need to prime it before painting. Primer comes in both aerosol spray cans and bottles. Most people prime in white though there are some that swear by priming in black or in gray.</li>



<li>Spray primer is fast, relatively easy, and generally covers well but requires good ventilation, relatively low humidity, median temperatures and some practice. A wide variety of spray primers is available and used: ask a group of ten painters which spray primer that they like, and you will likely get ten (or twelve) answers.</li>



<li>A good sized camp likes Citadel primers. From what I have heard, the primer available in Europe is quite good, but the version available in the US is not so good. Citadel primer is available at your FLGS and Games Workshop stores for about $8.</li>



<li>Some competition level painters prefer Tamiya Fine Surface Primer or Floquil Spray Primer. Both can be found at modeling shops or online for about $5-$8 a can.</li>



<li>Another group finds that Krylon primer or Rustoleum is just fine. Krylon can be found at arts and craft stores and artists supply houses. Rustoleum can be found at arts and craft stores and hardware stores. Both will cost about $3-$6.</li>



<li>I personally like Duplicolor Sandable Primer. Duplicolor primers are made for the automotive use, but it goes on smoothly and gives a fine surface without obscuring detail (unless you have poor priming technique). Duplicolor primer comes in several colors including white, black, and gray. Avoid the Filler and Primer version though. Duplicolor primer runs about $5 at most automotive parts stores, some stores will carry only certain colors.</li>



<li>Using a brush on primer has the advantage of being more practical when spray priming will not work and gives you more control over priming. The Reaper Master Series includes a brush on primer, and most paint lines (Vallejo, Floquil, Tamiya) also have a brush on primer. Even if you prefer the speed of spray priming, you might want to keep a bottle of brush on primer around to do primer touchups. Brush on primer will be available where the rest of the paint lines are sold. The Reaper MSP Brush On Primer is $3 a bottle.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li >Paint
<ul>
<li >What paint to buy will be one of the more important decisions that you will make. A number of different paint lines specifically for miniature painting are available from different manufacturers, and you can also use artist paint, craft paint, or even animation cel paint. Using paint specifically designed for miniature painting will make your life easier, even if the miniature paint costs more initially. The choice of which brand will partly be determined by what is easily available and what your personal painting style is.</li>



<li>Naturally, I am going to recommend the Reaper Master Series Paints. The paints are available in a wide array of colors organized into triads, are smooth, dilute well, and come in dropper bottles. The triad organization is particularly helpful when starting out since most of the triads are organized as a highlight color, a mid or base tone, and a shadow color that are designed to work together. The Reaper MSPs retail for $3 a bottle and are available at your FLGS as well as online.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Brushes
<ul>
<li>Having the right brush will make learning to paint a much more enjoyable experience. Trying to paint with a bad brush will make painting a more trying and frustrating one.</li>



<li>Even if you are just learning to paint, I recommend getting at least one (if not two or three) of the highest grade of brushes: Kolinsky Sable brushes. A good Kolinsky Sable brush will form a very fine point, last a long time, and have good spring and good snap. I prefer Winsor and Newton Series 7 brushes (in normal size), though the Reaper, Da Vinci, and Raphael brushes are also good. Note that not all &#8220;Kolinsky Sable&#8221; brushes are of the same quality: even if the brand has two &#8220;Kolinsky Sable&#8221; lines, the more expensive line will likely have a different feel and performance than the cheaper line. A Winsor &amp; Newton Series 7 #2 brush will cost $28 at an artist supply house, but Dick Blick sells them for about $10, so shop around a bit.</li>



<li>If you want to economize a bit, you can buy a Golden Taklon or &#8220;White Sable&#8221; brush at an arts and crafts store or artist supply house. These synthetic brushes will work fairly well, but won&#8217;t last as long before they splay and hook at the tip. Even if you buy a set of Kolinsky Sable brushes, you will probably want to pick up one or two synthetic brushes for mixing colors, applying paint over rough surfaces, when you are in a hurry, doing dry brushing, or when you need to reach a tight, highly recessed part of a mini. Look at spending about $3-8 per synthetic brush.</li>



<li>In terms of sizes, I recommend getting at least three to start: a #2 (or a #1), a #0, and a #3/0. The #2 will be useful for basecoats, and if you get a good Kolinsky Sable brush, it will have a fine enough point that you can use it for most of your painting. The #0 will be useful for details and for working on shading or highlighting. You will probably only use the #3/0 for the tiniest details.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>A Palette
<ul>
<li>You will want some surface upon which to dilute and mix paints. Some people use old CDs, disposable plastic plates, or even mini blisters. A 99 cent ceramic tile from the hardware store also works well. I like using a round porcelain artist&#8217;s palette with multiple wells. I have a 7 well flower version for when I am traveling and a 12 well one for use at home. If you to purchase a porcelain palette, go to an artist supply house or look at an internet retailer like Dick Blick. The palettes cost about $5-$13.</li>
</ul>
</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
<li>Water Cup, Paper Towels, Newspaper
<ul>
<li>These are just the other basics that you will need to paint. The cup is for your wash water; paper towels are for unloading your paint brush and clean up; and you will want to have some newspaper, a plastic garbage bag, a rubber placement, or something else to protect the surface on which you are painting from accidental spills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Brush Soap
<ul>
<li>If you take good care of your brushes, they will last months or even years (if they are good Kolinsky Sable brushes). Essential to making brushes last is rinsing them out frequently when painting and then using brush soap religiously after painting. Brush soap is designed to clean the paint off the brushes without drying the hairs and can also be left on the brush to shape the brush. I prefer Master&#8217;s Brush Cleaner and Preserver which seems to keep my brushes very clean and performing very well. Master&#8217;s Brush Cleaner and Preserver can be found at arts and crafts stores, artists supply houses, and online for around $4-$8.</li>



<li>Whatever you do, do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;use regular dish soap on brushes made with natural hairs: dish soap will remove the natural oils in the hairs and damage your brushes.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Sealer / Varnish</p>



<ul id="block-e2da3db1-6089-4514-b0bf-1240c70a2d16">
<li>After you have painted your mini, you will want to protect your hard work with a sealer (aka varnish).</li>



<li>Sealer (more commonly called varnish in the art world) comes in either spray or liquid (brush on) forms. The spray varnish is faster and easier to apply. However, spray varnish should only be used then the temperature is mild (50 deg to 85 deg), the low humidity is low (less than 65% in my experience), there is no wind, and you have good ventilation. Liquid varnish is applied like a clear paint and takes longer to apply. However, you can use brush on varnish almost anywhere you can paint.</li>



<li>Both types of varnish come in gloss, matte, and satin finishes. The gloss finish yields a tougher and stronger, but a glossy finish can make a painted mini look a little like plastic. The matte finish takes less abuse but has a more pleasing matte appearance. A satin finish is somewhere in between. I recommend using a gloss coat followed by one or more matte coats to get the best of both worlds.</li>



<li>I tend to recommend getting Krylon Spray Varnish in both gloss and matte formulations as long as environmental conditions are normally suitable for spraying. I use the UV Resistant variety. The cans cost about $5 at arts and craft stores and can also be found at artist supply houses and Walmart. Many competition level painters do prefer Testor&#8217;s Dullcote for the matte finish. Dullcote can be found at arts and crafts stores with a model section and modeling shops for $5 to $8.</li>



<li>If you want (or need) to use brush on varnish, I recommend Liquitex Gloss Varnish ($8 at arts and crafts stores and artist supply houses) and the Reaper MSP Brush on Sealer ($3) or the Liquitex Matte Varnish (also $8).</li>



<li>Eventually, you'll probably want to get gloss and matte finishes in both spray and liquid varnishes for maximum flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Files 
<ul>
<li>A good set of small hobby files will make removing flash and mold lines easier than a hobby knife since the files will be able to reach more places than the hobby knife will. Regular hobby files run around $5 to $10 and can be found at hardware stores, modeling shops, and some internet retailers.</li>



<li>Regular hobby files are made of a hard metal. You may want to consider purchasing diamond coated files. Diamond coated files are more expensive ($20 for a 220 Grit set at MicroMark) and harder to find but work faster and better than regular hobby files.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Good Lighting
<ul>
<li>You can paint using a regular lamp or at the kitchen table as long as the light is decent. However, if you can work under a bright natural light, you will more easily see details on the mini. &#8220;Natural light&#8221; bulbs can be found at hardware stores. Hardware stores carry &#8220;natural light&#8221; or &#8220;daylight&#8221; bulbs in both incandescent ($2-$4) and fluorescent ($5+) varieties. I prefer the fluorescent variety since the light tends to be whiter and less heat is generated by the bulb.</li>



<li>Some painters like Ott-Lite lamps. Ott-Lite lamps are advertised as being very good at reproducing daylight and the small versions can be very handy since they can be easily placed in a suitcase for painting on the road. However, Ott-Lites tend to be quite expensive, with entry level models starting at about $70 or so at arts and crafts stores and artist supply houses.</li>



<li>Shown in the picture are my two lights: a portable Ott-Lite on the left and a magnifying lamp with two daylight fluorescent bulbs on the right. I normally just use the magnifying lamp and save the Ott-Lite for when I am on a trip (and want to paint) or need to take pictures.</li>
</ul>
